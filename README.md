## BLOCK EXPLORER

This is an Ethereum Block Explorer that was created using the Ethers.js library and the Etherscan API. It was an introduction to understanding transactions 
on Ethereum. Next.js was used to create this web application. MongoDB was used to create a simple user database. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## MongoDB
