## BLOCK EXPLORER
This is an Ethereum Block Explorer that was created using the Ethers.js library and the Etherscan API. It was an introduction to understanding transactions 
on Ethereum. Next.js was used to create this web application. MongoDB was used to create a simple user database. 

There are scripts here that utilise the Zerion SDK and Zapper API to extract DeFi information from the Blockchain, this can be done in a per user basis. The idea was to create an asset management tool for DeFi, on top of the existing Block explorer. 

Moralis was used to sign users in using metamask. 

## Getting Started
npm i (install dependencies)
npm run dev (Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.)
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## MongoDB
Look at .env.local file for the details:
